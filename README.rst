 Jencil
******************************

**Under developing**

Jencil is a JavaScript plugin which allows you to turn any textarea into
a markup editor. It is inspired by `markItUp! <http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/>`_

While markItUp! is not meant to be "Full-Features-Out-of-theBox"-editor.
Jencil also is lightweight and customizable. The difference between markItUp!
is that Jencil is a little bit more powerful than markItUp! while Jencil has

-   Fullscreen mode
-   Tab indentation
-   Autoindent
-   Preview (Quick view) panel
-   Help panel
-   User can change document type (not yet)
-   Plugabble editor/viewer/helper/profile
-   Internationalization with i18next
